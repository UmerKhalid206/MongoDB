There might be a time when you want to store related information in separate documents of maybe in separate collections,

when we want to store data in different collections but also ensure it's clear that those collections are related we can use references

Reference save the _id field of one document in another document as a link between two

Using refernces is called linking or data normalization

# Key Points

- No duplication of data
- Smaller documents
- Querying from multiple documents costs extra resources and impacts read performance
